Hi guys,

here is no code here, all reports should reference to the user experience of Omnilite- 0.18.1 which can be downloaded here:

https://omnilite.org/

Please create an issue for each question. The discussion can happen in the comments to it. 

In a next step we can use the Wiki to formulate a general question and the respective answer / work around.

P.s. this is my first contribution initative in github. Any suggestions are highly appreciated.

Thank you and have a great day. 

Peter
